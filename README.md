Knowing that the most likely target for the product are consumers that are health conscious and who care about sustainability, -aside from other characteristics like diet and age-. We had the objective of identifying which framing will increase cricket flour buying intention, when narrowing down the sample to some of the identified characteristics. 

## Literature review: what have others found?
A.	Sustainability and willingness to consume insects normally go hand in hand.
B.	Those people who had tried insects before are more likely to consume them.
C.	Utility value messages increased willingness to try insect products.
D.	People are generally disgusted by the idea of eating insects (there’s a negative bias towards these products-except for some locations)

## Methodology:
## 1.	Pre-test: which prompt between the following would generate more impact
Control:  Cricket flour is made from finely ground crickets. It can be used in baking, cooking, or as an ingredient in protein bars and snacks.

**Control:** *Cricket flour is made from finely ground crickets. It can be used in baking, cooking, or as an ingredient in protein bars and snacks.*

| **Sustainability** | *Be part of the movement reducing food’s footprint. Cricket flour saves land and water with every meal* | *Every choice count: switch to cricket flour and cut your environmental impact without giving up nutrition.* |
| **Health**        | *Upgrade your meals with the natural protein source athletes are turning to.* | *Fuel your body with clean, high-quality protein. Cricket flour makes every meal a performance boost.* |

Test impact of each prompt vs control
## 2. Assess relevant variables:

## Variables Measured

**Dependent Variables:**
- **Buying intention:** How likely is it that you buy the product?
- **Click:** (Behavioral) Did people click in the "want to receive more information about this product" link (Yes/no)

**Independent Variables:**
- **Health conscious:** From 1 to 5 how relevant is health-nutrition for you when deciding to buy a product?
- **Sustainability:** From 1 to 5 how relevant is sustainability for you when deciding to buy a product?
- **Prior exposure:** Have you eaten crickets or insect-based food before? (yes/no)
- **Cooking frequency:** How often do you cook at home? 0–7 days/week
- **Age:** 18–24, 25–34, 35–44, 44-above
- **Gender:** Male, female, non-binary
- **Location:** Country of origin

Sample:
1000 Prolific participants all around Europe. 
Survey was created with attention checks and time limits to try to reassure data quality.

## Results:

Out of all the messages, people prompted with the prompt “Be part of the movement reducing food’s footprint. Cricket flour saves land and water with every meal” had an increased probability of being in the high buying intention group by about 30 percentage points (when controlling for other variables). In other words, the probability of being in the high buying intention group when presented with the control prompt was 69%, and when presented with the sustainability_social prompt was 98%.

The message “Upgrade your meals with the natural protein source athletes are turning to” had a similar effect, though less strong than the sustainability, social one. The probability of people being in the group with high buying intention was 26 percentage points higher points (when controlling for other variables) than those who were presented with the regular description of the product. That is to say, the probability of being in the group with high buying intention when presented with the control prompt was 69%, and when presented with the health_sustainability prompt it was 95%, a difference of 26% points. 

People who had tried cricket products are 23 percentage points more likely to be in the high buying intention category than those who haven’t. In other words, the probability of being in the high buying intention group and not having tried insect products is 69%, but the probability of being in that same group and having tried them is 95% points (when controlling for other variables), generating a difference of 25 percentage points.

Also, people who cook more frequently have a higher probability of being in the groups of high buying intention by 19 percentage points. That is to say that the reference group, or people that cook around 3 times a week have a probability of being in the high buying intention group of 69%, whereas people who cook 6 times or more have a probability of 87% of being in that group. 
Men from the sample have less probability of being in higher buying intention groups, compared to women and non-binary. The probability of them being in the low buying intention group is 10 percentage points higher than women. 
Similarly, people 44 or older had a higher probability of being in the low buying intention group of 20 percentage points compared to the youngest group 18-24.

### Conclusion:
The sustainability-focused message "Be part of the movement reducing food's footprint. Cricket flour saves land and water with every meal" emerged as the most effective approach, increasing high buying intention probability by 30 percentage points compared to standard product descriptions. This social-environmental framing significantly outperformed health-focused messaging, which showed a still-substantial but lower 26 percentage point increase.

**Ideal Customer Profile:**
The data identifies a clear target demographic with the highest purchase probability:

- **Demographics:** Women and non-binary individuals aged 18-24 (men show 10pp lower intention; consumers 44+ show 20pp lower intention)
- **Behavioral characteristics:** Frequent home cooks (6+ times per week show 19pp higher intention than occasional cooks)
- **Experience level:** Those with prior insect product experience (23pp higher intention than newcomers)

The findings suggest cricket flour marketing should prioritize environmental consciousness and collective action over nutritional benefits alone. The substantial impact of cooking frequency (19pp increase) and prior experience (23pp increase) indicates that targeting engaged home cooks and implementing product sampling initiatives could significantly enhance conversion rates.
